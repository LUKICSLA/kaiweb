# Contributing
We need help with the localization of the website _mainly into the English_ language.
If you want to translate any paragraph or any part of the text, feel free to do so and open a pull request once you've done with the localization.

# When will my file be implemented?
Localized text will be merged to the stable branch after review by us to match the needed criteria and to ensure that it keeps proper formatting and has no error.
Localized texts should stay in this folder - they will be ignored by git.
