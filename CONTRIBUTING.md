# How to contribute
This document is a subject of change.

## How I can help?
- If you've found a bug or have an idea about a new feature, continue reading below.
- If you want to help us, you can look for issues labeled with a [help needed badge](https://github.com/LUKICSLA/kaiweb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and create a pull request with a draft/fix.

## Did you find a bug?
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/LUKICSLA/kaiweb/issues).
- If you're _not_ able to find an open issue addressing a problem and you want to open an issue, [open a new one](https://github.com/LUKICSLA/kaiweb/issues/new).
 
## Have you done a patch that fixes a bug?
- Create a new branch with the patch and open a new GitHub pull request.
- Ensure that the PR title and description clearly describe the problem and solution.
- Changes that are cosmetic (code formatting etc) are also accepted.

## Have an idea about a new feature or change an existing one?
- Create a new branch and open a new GitHub pull request - we'll review it as soon as possible.

# Why do I have to create a new branch?
The latest source code updates/changes should stay outside the `stable` branch until we review it and the source code is valid. If you want to propose any changes to the source code, please create a new branch and make a pull request to a `stable` branch!
