The repository contains source files for the website of the Department of applied informatics Faculty of Natural Sciences of the University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in Trnava. [This website](http://kai.rf.gd/) is a project of 3 students for the subject Team project. We plan to update the web and its source files in the future.

# Live preview
The site is live on [GitHub Pages](https://lukicsla.github.io/kaiweb/) (the page is deployed automatically) and [on external hosting](http://kai.rf.gd/).
**We _don't_ guarantee that the live preview on the external hosting will be the same as on GitHub because we no longer update external hosting sources frequently.**
