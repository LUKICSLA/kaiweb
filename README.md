# Stable/Development branches - usage & proposal
Latest source code updates/changes should stay in `development` branch until they're tested and source code is validated. 

**If you want to propose any changes to source code, please use `development` branch and create a pull request for `stable` branch!**

# Live preview
Site was deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://lukicsla.github.io/kaiweb/) (and page is always updated automatically when commit to  `stable` branch is pushed) and [on external hosting](http://kai.rf.gd/).

**We _don't_ guarantee that the live preview on the external hosting will be the same as here on GitHub because we no longer update external hosting sources so frequently.**
